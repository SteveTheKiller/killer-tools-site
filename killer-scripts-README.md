## AMORT.ps1

Advanced Windows tune-up script designed for MSP field deployment and remote management support. Version 15.5.

Runs a sequence of hardening and optimization tasks appropriate for standardizing client machines. The script collects system data via WMI/CIM (with fallback for PowerShell 7 compatibility), disables Windows AI features and Recall functionality, hardens privacy settings across all user profiles, removes OEM bloat and manufacturer software, purges temporary files and caches, resets the Windows Update database via DISM, executes DISM cleanup operations and System File Checker repairs, and forces TRIM optimization on SSDs.

Key function Get-SystemData handles WMI to CIM compatibility by detecting PowerShell edition and using CIM for PS7 or WMI for earlier versions.

RMM/Unattended support enabled. Safe to execute on systems with active users without intervention required. Exit code 0 on success.

## BERET.ps1

BitLocker lifecycle manager for provisioning, monitoring, and recovery key escrow. Version 6.0.

Interactive wizard for managing BitLocker across domain and non-domain systems. Detects TPM status and Secure Boot configuration, offers FIPS or Standard mode selection for new BitLocker deployments, initializes TPM when needed, supports Active Directory and Entra ID escrow for recovery keys, generates and displays recovery keys in the console, and enforces policy refresh via gpupdate.

Interactive UI uses colored prompts for user feedback. Detects domain membership and domain controller status to route escrow appropriately. Returns exit code 0 for RMM compatibility.

RMM/Unattended support requires pre-configuration or will prompt for selections. Suitable for enterprise key management workflows.

## DEBLOAT.ps1

Windows 11 standardization script removing OEM manufacturer bloat, AI features, and telemetry. Version 2.0.

Targets HP, Dell, ASUS, and Acer OEM software removal. Disables Windows Recall and AI-related features. Applies telemetry caps and enforces privacy settings. Hardens Microsoft Edge configuration. Cleans privacy and telemetry artifacts across all user profiles, including the Default User template, ensuring that new profiles created after execution inherit the hardened baseline.

Key function Invoke-ComprehensiveUserCleanup iterates all user hives (local and remote registry paths) to remove traces of telemetry services, advertising, tracking, and AI features at the per-user level.

RMM/Unattended support enabled. Processes all profiles atomically in a single execution. Exit code 0 on success.

## DEFEND.ps1

Kernel-level Windows security auditing covering hardware, firmware, software, and threat detection. Version 2.3.

Performs comprehensive security assessment of TPM, Secure Boot, HVCI (Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity), and Windows Defender hardening. Configures the Windows Firewall based on domain status (domain-joined machines receive more restrictive inbound rules; workgroup machines use less restrictive rules). Triggers Defender threat definitions synchronization. Executes a full malware scan with live IOPS reporting so the administrator can monitor disk activity and scan progress. Correlates event logs to identify threats and suspicious activity. Generates exit code 0 for RMM integration.

RMM/Unattended support enabled. Long-running due to full scan; suitable for off-hours scheduling. Detailed threat reporting for enterprise SOC integration.

## FACTS.ps1

Foxit PDF reader installation auditing and automatic update blocking. Version 2.3.

Detects Foxit PDF Reader installation. Blocks automatic updates by hardening registry keys and suppressing the Foxit update service. Creates a scheduled maintenance task running hourly to self-heal and re-enforce the update block, ensuring settings persist across reboots and manual changes.

Useful for organizations standardizing on Foxit while preventing unwanted automatic upgrades. Returns exit code 0 for RMM compatibility.

RMM/Unattended support enabled.

Multi-threaded network scanning discovers printers on the local network via port 9100 (LPD) and port 631 (CUPS). Scrapes printer HTTP/Web server interfaces to extract device information and recommended drivers. Intelligently matches local driver stores to discovered devices. Falls back to IPP Class Driver if manufacturer driver unavailable. Supports manual IP entry and UNC shared printer paths.

Interactive UI with table output of discovered printers, driver availability, and installation status. Core function Invoke-MultiThreadedNetworkScan uses PowerShell runspace threading for parallel port scanning.

## Script Statistics

Total scripts: 17

Key characteristics across the suite:

Exit code 0 on success is standard across all scripts for RMM compatibility. Many scripts support parameter-driven unattended execution. Interactive versions include colored UI feedback, progress bars, and user prompts where configuration decisions are needed. Most scripts handle both domain-joined and workgroup machines. PowerShell 7 (Core) compatibility is maintained where needed via CIM/WMI abstraction layers. Comprehensive error handling prevents silent failures in production environments.
